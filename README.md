--->I'm currently using Filemaker Pro 10.0v3 to keep track of my contacts. Unfortunately, Filemaker Pro 13 is the latest and 
it is expensive. The 10.0v3 is not supported by the latest Apple ios. So I am looking for an app that I can use with the latest
Apple ios AND to which I can export all my contacts (5000+) currently stored in FMP 10.0v3. I'm hoping DBeaver will be that app.
Comments and suggestions welcome!
